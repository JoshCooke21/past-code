# past-code
This repository contains examples of code I've written as part of my degree. They are the best examples of my coding ability.

=========== ELLIPSOID ================

The ellipsoid programs are written in C++ and C++/CUDA, and are compiled using g++ and nvcc respectively.

=========== ELECTROSTATIC ================

The electrostatic programs are written in FORTRAN90 and can be compiled using the gfortran compiler. 
The parallel program uses CPU parallelization with MPI.

The result of the program is written to a pgm file.


=========== GRAPHENE ================

The graphene program is written in FORTRAN90 and uses the FUNCTIONS module.
It is compiled using gfortran.
